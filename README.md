this is a exploratory data analytical code which analysed the data of students, accounting their cgpa,iq, and whether they got placement or not (using these traits).
there is a csv file (placement.csv) which i have downloaded from kaggle datasets.
the csv file has 4 columns namely index(int), cgpa(float), iq(float), placement(int)

columns description :- 
index : index from 0 to 99
cgpa : cgpa of the student in 4 years of study
iq : tells about the iq of that particular student
placement : tells about whether the student got placement or not . (0 : no placment , 1 : got placement)

from the data analytics, i got various exciting results such as cgpa vs iq , why high iq student didnt got his placement, etc.
